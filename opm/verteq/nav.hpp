/**
 * There are three types of indices used in this module:
 *
 * (1) Cartesian coordinate
 * (2) Cartesian index
 * (3) Global identity
 *
 * The Cartesian coordinate is an (i,j)-tuple into the cornerpoint grid
 * structure.
 *
 * The Cartesian index, is a flat integer which has is
 * determined solely by the structure of the grid, regardless of whether
 * there are any active elements. It can be calculated from the coordinates
 * if the extent of the grid is known. We use this to efficiently store
 * data for each possible position in the grid without using a predefined
 * size or dynamic structure for each column.
 *
 * The global identity is the index which is assigned to it in the grid
 * structure, after inactive elements are discarded. This is the 'identity'
 * of the cell in the rest of the simulator. Cells that aren't active are
 * not assigned an identity.
 *
 * The value types defined here provide a way to address location in
 * the grid in a type-safe manner to let the compiler help us keep track
 * of the real meaning of indices.
 *
 * The navigation classes provide a way to define an enumeration of the
 * grid without resorting to inline integer arithmetic inside the other
 * functions. An optimizing compiler should be able to generate equally
 * fast code as hand-coded index calculations, when using these classes.
